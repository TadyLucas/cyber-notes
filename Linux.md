| Symbol / Operator | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| &                 | This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal. |
| &&                | This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal. |
| >                 | This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere. |
| >>                | This operator does the same function as the `>` operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten). |
